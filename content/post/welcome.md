Welcome to pep & honey - my little shrine to cooking and eating. I've always had an interesting relationship with food and as I've gotten older - it's definitely gotten . . . weirder.

Though I didn't realize it at the time, in my younger years I was basically able to eat whatever I wanted and stayed relatively thin.

Once I started my first real job, is when I started eating a bit worse than I normally would and all the baked goods we all brought in didn't help. I started slowly gaining weight through the years.  
  
I also have fibromyalgia - which comes with its own set of issues but one of them is the lovely fact that I suffer from IBS. I'm allergic to fish and dairy, and I'm wildly sensitive to certain other foods.

Navigating the world of food and being able to enjoy eating has always been a tough thing. One thing that has remained the same is that I love cooking and baking. I love good food and tastes; it just has to look a little different for me.

I know I'm not alone either. There are so many people who have allergies or sensitivities or illnesses that affect this part of their lives too. So if you're one of them - hi, I'm Jen and I'd love to show you I how I do it, even if I don't actually know what I'm doing :)
