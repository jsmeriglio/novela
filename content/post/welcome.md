Welcome to pep & honey - my shrine to my inner monologue. Originally, I thought this was going to be a more focused place for cooking and food. 

The problem is that my brain has many thoughts and opinions on a multitude of subjects. It only seems fit that I give my thoughts a place to spread out. 

I cannot tell you how many blogs I've started and abandoned over the years - which is why I'll be honest with you; this is going to be interesting. 

The only way that I will stay invested, is if I do this on my terms; not on the terms of what the blogging community dictates. 

Meaning this:

* I probably won't have a schedule for posting
* the topics are going to be random
* there won't be a singular theme
* the writing may not be overly edited and polished
* there may be an abundance of unrelated dog photos 

If you're cool with seeing where this very loose experiment goes - then I'm so pleased to have you join in on the adventure!
